A narrative or story is a report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, or still or moving images,[1][2] or both. The word derives from the Latin verb narrare, "to tell", which is derived from the adjective gnarus, "knowing" or "skilled".

"Evidence strongly suggests that humans in all cultures come to cast their own identity in some sort of narrative form. 
We are inveterate storytellers."
